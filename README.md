- 👋 Hi, I’m @ascyphermoonshot
- 👀 I’m interested in plants, data science, pentesting AI, SDR and biohacking
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL
- 🏆 my current goal is making a scraper that sorts the elements from a Wikipedia list by "popularity" and a version that gets the most popular poisonous plants.
- 🤳 My pipe dream projects would be building an SDR capable cyberdeck with sensor module, an hyperlocal warning system for heatwaves, a rainwater harvesting filter with water quality monitor and inducing polyploidy in Eruca vesicaria while having it express GFP
